    "### Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching the content of a web page and parsing it to retrieve specific information. This technique is commonly used for data collection, analysis, and automation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of Web Scraping:\n",
    "1. **HTTP Requests**: Sending requests to a website's server to retrieve HTML content using libraries like `requests` or `urllib`.\n",
    "2. **HTML Parsing**: Extracting specific data from the HTML structure using tools like `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml`.\n",
    "3. **Data Storage**: Saving the extracted data in a structured format such as CSV, JSON, or a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Tools and Libraries:\n",
    "- **Python**:\n",
    "    - `BeautifulSoup` (for parsing HTML and XML)\n",
    "    - `Scrapy` (a web scraping framework)\n",
    "    - `Selenium` (for scraping dynamic content)\n",
    "- **JavaScript**:\n",
    "    - `Puppeteer` (for headless browser automation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ethical Considerations:\n",
    "- Always check the website's `robots.txt` file to ensure compliance with its scraping policies.\n",
    "- Avoid overloading servers with excessive requests.\n",
    "- Respect copyright and data privacy laws."
