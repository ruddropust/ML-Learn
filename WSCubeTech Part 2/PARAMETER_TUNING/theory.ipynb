These parameters are typically learned from the training data and are used to make predictions.

Examples of model hyperparameters include the learning rate in a neural network, the number of neighbors in a k-nearest neighbors algorithm, and the depth of a decision tree.\n",

    "\n",
    "Tuning refers to the process of optimizing the hyperparameters of a machine learning model to improve its performance. This involves selecting the best set of hyperparameters that result in the highest accuracy or other performance metrics on a validation dataset. Tuning can be done using various techniques such as grid search, random search, or more advanced methods like Bayesian optimization.\n",

    "### Techniques for Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "- **Grid Search**: Exhaustively searches through a specified subset of hyperparameters.\n",
    "- **Random Search**: Randomly samples hyperparameters from a specified distribution.\n",
    "- **Bayesian Optimization**: Uses probabilistic models to find the optimal hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of tuning is to find the hyperparameters that yield the best performance for the model on unseen data.\n"
