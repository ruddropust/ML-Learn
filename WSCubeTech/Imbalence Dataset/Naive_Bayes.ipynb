    "# Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It quantifies the uncertainty associated with the occurrence of events and is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Independent Probability vs Dependent Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Independent Probability\n",
    "Independent probability refers to the likelihood of two events occurring where the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other. For example, flipping a coin and rolling a die are independent events. The probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependent Probability\n",
    "Dependent probability refers to the likelihood of two events occurring where the occurrence of one event affects the occurrence of the other. For example, drawing two cards from a deck without replacement is a dependent event. The probability of the second event depends on the outcome of the first event."
